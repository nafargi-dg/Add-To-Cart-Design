# Simple Add-to-Cart Animation


This project implements a simple add-to-cart animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the user clicks the "Add to Cart" button, an item
is added to the cart with a smooth animation effect. Additionally, the project dynamically updates the text container elements to provide visual 
feedback to the user, indicating that an item has been successfully added to the cart.

## Features

- **Interactive Button:** The "Add to Cart" button provides a responsive and interactive user experience.
  
- **Animation Effect:** Upon clicking the button, an animation effect is applied to simulate the addition of an item to the cart, enhancing the user experience.

- **Dynamic Text Updates:** The text container elements are dynamically updated to reflect changes in the cart status, providing clear feedback to the user.
